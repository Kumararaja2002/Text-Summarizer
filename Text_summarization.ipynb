Isliye, maine yah faisla kiya ki main bhi is karyakram mein aapke seva mein aadheen ho kar ismein shamil hoon.\\n\\nHamare desh mein, sarkarayein aane-jane wali hain, bahut se yojna banai jaati hain, charchayein hoti hain, aur bade-bade vada kiye jaate hain. Lekin, mere anubhav aur dhangon se is baare mein socha gaya ki sabse mahatvapoorn cheez jo samne aayi hai, wo hai ki sarkar ke plans ke labh pahunchne mein koi mushkila na ho.\\n\\nAgar Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojna aapke liye hai, toh aapko apna ghar milti chahiye. Aapko sarkari karyalayon ke ghoomne ki aavashyakata nahin hai. Sarkar aapko pahunchni chahiye. Maine is jati ki jati hai ki aapne 4 crore parivaaron ko apna pucca ghar mil gaya hai. Lekin, mere anubhav se pata chala hai ki kuchh logon ko sarkari labh se binaa koi mushkila na ho.\\n\\nIsliye, main Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra par phir se ghoomna chahta hoon, taki main logon ki dhangon sun sakoon ki unhone sarkari yojnaon ke labh kya kya pahunchaaye hain aur kya vah unke liye sahi the, aur kya unhein binaa koi adhikar nahin pahunchaaya gaya hai. Yeh Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra mere liye ek pratyekshan hai. Main chahta hoon ki main aap se sun sakoon ki maine jo nirnay liye hain, vah sach mein aapke samne aaye hain ya na.\\n\\nYeh sab kuchh dhang se check karne ki zaroorat hai ki jo kuchh kaam tha, usne kya kiya hai. Mainne recently kuchh logon se mulaqat ki, jo Aayushman card ka upyog karke gahril rogon ka ilaj karwane mein aapne aayu ka upyog kiya hai. Ek aadmi ne ghamat wali dard se ghuzaar kiya aur Aayushman card ka upyog karke uska operation karwaya. Ab vah theek ho gaya hai.\\n\\nBureaucrats, jo acchi yojna banaate hain, paperwork ko tez karte hain, aur paise allocate karte hain, bhi khush hote hain ki 50 ya 100 logon ko paise mil gaye hain. Lekin, unke kaam ki satisfaction peak hoti hai jab ve dekhte hain ki unke kaam ka prabhaav kisi ka jeevan sukhadta mein badhaya hai. Jab ve dekhte hain ki unke paise ne kisi aam admi ki jeevan mein kuchh sukhadta lagaayi hai, to ve khush hote hain.\\n\\nIsliye, Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra ne bureaucrats ko bhi khush kiya hai. Unhein apne kaam mein jyada utsah mila hai, jab ve dekhte hain ki unke kaam ka prabhaav aam admi ke jeevan mein aaya hai.\\n\\nInme se kuchh hi log hain jo Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra ki shakti aur prabhaav ko samajhte hain. Mainne bureaucrats ke saath baat ki, unhein khush diya, to maine khushi ki. Mainne suna hai ki kuchh logon ka jeevan badal gaya hai. Ek aam aurat ne suna hai ki unhone 2 lakh rupaye paaye, jab unke pati ke mrityuposhth ho gaye the. Ek behan ne suna hai ki gas stove aane se unke ghar mein rahne ki shart badal gayi hai. Isse lagta hai ki garibi hatane ki slogan ek cheez hai, lekin jeevan ke sthaan par badalne ki shakti ek aur cheez hai.'"

Today, it is indeed a thanks giving occasion. I would like to narr ate, how I \\nenjoyed every minute of my tenure enriched by the wonderful assoc iation from each one \\nof you, hailing from different walks of life, be it politics, sci ence and technology, \\nacademics, arts, literature, business, judiciary, administration, local bodies, farming, \\nhome makers, special children, media and above all from the youth and st udent \\ncommunity who are the future wealth of our country. During my intera ction at \\nRashtrapati Bhavan in Delhi and at every state and union territor y as well as through my \\nonline interactions, I have many unique experiences to share with you, which signify the \\nfollowing important messages: \\n \\n1. Accelerate development : Aspiration of the youth, \\n \\n2. Empower villages, \\n \\n3. Mobilize rural core competence for competitiveness, \\n \\n4. Seed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth \\n \\n5. Defeat problems and succeed, \\n \\n6. Overcome problems through partnership, \\n \\n7. Courage in combating calamities, \\n \\n8. Connectivity for societal transformation, \\n \\n9. Defending the nation: Our pride and \\n \\n10. Youth movement for Developed India 2020. \\n \\nNow let me share with you each of the messages. \\n \\nAccelerate Development: Aspiration of the youth \\nWhile there were many significant events during my tenure, a que stion from a little girl \\nAnukriti of Sri Sathya Sai Jagriti Vidya Mandir School, of Dar wa village from Haryana, \\nduring children’s visit to Rashtrapati Bhavan on May 22, 2006, rings in my  mind ever \\nafter. \\n \\nAnukriti asked me “why India cannot become a developed nation before the year 2020”. I \\nappreciated the question and said it was indeed a thoughtful question and as sured her that \\nthat her dream would be taken to the highest institution of the nation and we would work'),\n",

It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens.

However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai  College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs.

It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai  College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been develope d into a \\ncultivable land. The villagers are busy in cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal and \\nmedicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing and above all \\nrunning marketing centers. It provides a sustainable economic development model for the \\nwhole region. \\n \\nDuring the last eight months, people of Periyar PURA villages technologically supported \\nby Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have w orked with experts \\nfrom Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, for  which core \\ncompetence and raw material are available in Thanjavur district. They developed \\ninternationally competitive prototypes for 55 life style products wi th support of JETRO \\nspecialists and feedback from exhibitions at Delhi and Tokyo. This co -operative venture \\nhas enhanced the innovative ability of the people of all the 65 villages  enabling them to \\ndevelop and produce internationally acceptable products. I have seen si milar type of \\nPURA being established in many states.

Our country is blessed with natural resources, has shown c onsiderable \\nprogress in the last sixty years, and above all we have hard wor king people particularly \\nthe power of the 540 million youth of the country. Every sector of our count ry has given \\nme the \\nconfidence that India can become a developed nation well before 2020. Whomsoeve r, I \\nmet they constantly ask what they can give to the nation. We should c onstantly strive to \\nempower such members of the society. With this spirit, I am extr emely happy that we are \\non the right path. Here I am reminded of a famous poem: \\n\"When you wish upon a star, \\nMakes no difference who you are, \\nAnything your heart desires, \\nWill come to you” \\nThis poem is true to all of us, and particularly for our youth and i f they aim great, I am \\nsure they will reach close to the target or the target. \\n \\nMy dear citizens, let us resolve to continue to work for realizing the missions of \\ndeveloped India 2020 with the following distinctive profile. \\n \\n1. A Nation where the rural and urban divide has reduced to a thin line. \\n \\n2. A Nation where there is an equitable distribution and adequate acce ss to energy and \\nquality water. \\n \\n3. A Nation where agriculture, industry and service sector work together in symphony. \\n \\n4. A Nation where education with value system is not denied to any meritorious \\ncandidates because of societal or economic discrimination. \\n \\n5. A Nation which is the best destination for the most talented s cholars, scientists, and \\ninvestors.'),\n",

      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, there is not enough information provided in the text to create a complete summary of the speech. However, I can provide a possible summary based on the given text:\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker was asked a question by Anukriti about why India cannot become a developed nation before 2020. The speaker appreciated the question and assured Anukriti that her dream would be taken seriously and considered at the highest level of the nation.\n",

      "The speech focuses on the aspirations of India's youth and the empowerment of villages. The speaker highlights the desire of India's 540 million youth to live in a prosperous, safe, and proud India. \n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker shares a personal experience from a visit to Nagaland in 2002, where they saw an empowered village council functioning effectively. However, they also noted the need for better physical connectivity through quality roads to enable faster movement of products from villages to markets.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker then mentions the initiative of Periyar Maniammai College of Technology for Women in setting up a PURA (Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas) complex, which involves 65 villages with a population of 300,000. This complex provides three types of connectivity - physical, electronic, and knowledge - leading to economic connectivity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The key points of the speech are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Empowering villages to deal with their development and connecting them with urban societies.\n",
      "2. The need for better physical connectivity through quality roads.\n",
      "3. The initiative of Periyar PURA complex, which provides urban amenities in rural areas, including healthcare, education, and vocational training.\n",
      "\n",
      "The overall message of the speech is that empowering villages and connecting them with urban societies can lead to large-scale employment generation and creation of entrepreneurs, ultimately contributing to the growth and development of India.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech discusses a successful model of rural development, known as Periyar PURA (Physically Urbanising Rural Areas), which has been implemented in various villages. The key features of PURA include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Employment generation: Large-scale employment has been created through vocational training centers and 1000 self-help groups.\n",
      "2. Land development: 200 acres of wasteland have been converted into cultivable land, enabling villagers to engage in agriculture, plant Jatropha and herbal plants, and generate power using biomass.\n",
      "3. Entrepreneurship: Villagers have established marketing centers and are involved in food processing.\n",
      "4. Innovation: With the support of experts from Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) and Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women, villagers have developed internationally competitive prototypes for 55 lifestyle products.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech suggests that the PURA model can be replicated across the country to bridge the rural-urban divide, with an estimated 7000 PURAs needed to achieve this goal.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech is delivered by an unnamed person, likely a public figure, such as the President of India, Pratibha Patil or a similar dignitary. \n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker shares their enriching experience of meeting over 6,000 farmers from different states and union territories at Rashtrapati Bhavan. The farmers showed interest in various gardens, including Mughal, Herbal, Spiritual, Musical, Bio-diesel, and Nutrition Gardens. The speaker emphasizes the importance of agriculture in the nation's economy and highlights the need to double agricultural production with reduced resources and improve economic conditions through the \"Seed to Food\" principle.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker then shares a personal anecdote about meeting Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy, a person born without hands and legs, who despite his physical limitations, was confident and happy. When asked what he could do for Vidwan, the person replied that he wanted to sing in front of him, showing that he had found purpose and meaning in life despite his disabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker concludes by reflecting on the experience and the importance of empowering farmers, scientists, and industries to work together to increase agricultural GDP growth and overcome problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech discusses two main topics:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Inspiration and Talent**: The speaker shares a heartwarming story about a person with a physical challenge who showed immense talent in music. Despite his disability, he was encouraged by his parents, teachers, and others, which helped him to develop his art. The speaker was moved by his performance and the person's desire to give back to the community by sharing his talent with others.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Overcoming Disaster through Partnership**: The speaker talks about his experience visiting the village of Urusa in Jammu & Kashmir after the devastating earthquake in 2005. Despite the severe damage and losses, the villagers showed immense courage and resilience in the face of adversity. The speaker praises the efforts of the Army, Air Force, and state government in providing relief and aid to the residents. He concludes that the people of Urusa have become the masters of their problems, rather than allowing them to become their masters.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech appears to be by the President of India, but the specific president is not mentioned. Here's a summary of the speech:\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker describes a relief operation in a village where the Armed Forces, children, and villagers bravely participated. The speaker saw the villagers smiling and interacting with them, and witnessed the on-the-spot settlement of relief grants to victims of a recent earthquake.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker then shares a personal experience from 2005 when they visited the Car Nicobar Islands after the 2004 tsunami. The speaker was touched by the unique trait of the islanders, who considered the affected victims as their children and didn't have an orphanage. The speaker composed a poem called \"Sea Waves\" which was sung by the villagers with courage and enthusiasm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, the speaker mentions addressing the Pan African Parliament in 2004, but the speech seems to be cut off.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a speech to the Pan African Parliament on September 16, 2004, in Johannesburg, South Africa, a proposal was made for a Pan African e-Network. This network would connect 53 African countries with an estimated cost of $100 million. The network would include:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 12 universities (7 from India, 5 from Africa)\n",
      "- 17 Super Specialty Hospitals (12 from India, 5 from Africa)\n",
      "- 53 tele-medicine centers\n",
      "- 53 tele-education centers\n",
      "\n",
      "A pilot project on tele-education and tele-medicine in Ethiopia has already begun. As part of this, 34 Ethiopian students are enrolled in an MBA course from the Indira Gandhi National Open University. Additionally, specialists from CARE Hospital are providing telemedicine services.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech appears to be given by Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, the former President of India. Here is a summary of the speech:\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Kalam starts by mentioning India's contribution to Africa, specifically a tele-consultation service with doctors in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, which has been in operation since 2006. He expresses pride in India's technological advancements and their ability to bring about societal transformation in Africa.\n",
      "\n",
      "He then shifts his focus to the Indian Armed Forces, mentioning his personal experiences with the Army, Navy, and Air Force. He expresses admiration for the bravery, commitment, and devotion to duty shown by the Defence Forces, who are always vigilant and ready to counter any threats to the nation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, Dr. Kalam mentions a youth movement called Lead India 2020, which aims to transform young citizens into enlightened ones. He had met a group of citizens in Hyderabad who are implementing this vision and is optimistic about the potential of this movement to bring about positive change in India.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker, likely Dr. Manmohan Singh, attended a program by Lead India 2020 Foundation in Hyderabad, founded by Dr. N.B. Sudershan. The foundation is training students in various districts of Andhra Pradesh to become \"enlightened citizens.\" The speaker observed a positive impact on students in Medak district, noting improvements in self-discipline, respect for parents and teachers, and shedding of stage fear. A student leader, Ms. Padma, shared her experience of influencing her father to stop smoking after participating in the training program. The speaker believes that empowering the 540 million youth under the age of 25 through value-based education and leadership is crucial for the country's progress.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker emphasizes the importance of preserving India's rich culture and civilization for future generations. They mention that despite pursuing economic growth, efforts must be made to protect and promote the country's cultural heritage. The speaker expresses confidence in India's potential to become a developed nation, citing the country's progress, natural resources, and 540 million youth. They also highlight the need to empower individuals who are willing to contribute to the nation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker also mentions a famous poem about making a wish and achieving one's desires. They use this to inspire the youth to aim high and strive for their goals.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker concludes by outlining a distinctive profile for realizing the mission of a developed India 2020, which includes:\n",

      "\n",
      "A.P.J. Abdul Kalam's departing speech as the President of India focused on the key messages he learned during his five-year tenure. He emphasized the importance of:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Accelerating development with youth aspirations. The President was inspired by a child's question, \"why India cannot become a developed nation before the year 2020,\" which reflects the growing desire among the youth to live in a developed India. He shared this anecdote about Anukriti, which prompted him to work towards making her dream a reality. Over 15 lakh youth he met shared similar aspirations, representing the dreams of 540 million young people in the nation. The President believes that empowering the youth is crucial to accelerate development in the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Empowering villages. The President recalled his visit to Nagaland on October 26, 2002, where he met with tribal village council members and discussed village progress and citizen dreams. He saw a prosperous village with empowered council members taking decisions and was impressed by the potential for transformation in India's 600,000 villages if they were empowered to deal with their development and connected to urban societies. This vision is exemplified by the PURA initiative, which has successfully connected 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs, providing them with physical, electronic, and knowledge connectivities.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Leveraging rural core competencies for competitiveness. The President highlighted the initiative of Periyar Maniammai College of Technology for Women's Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas (PURA) complex, involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This initiative provided physical, electronic, and knowledge connectivities, leading to economic connectivity, and included healthcare centers, primary to post-graduate education, and vocational training centers. The villages became self-sufficient with 1000 self-help groups actively supporting the creation of entrepreneurs. The project also led to the development of 200 acres of waste land into cultivable land, with villagers cultivating Jatropha, herbal, and medicinal plants, generating power using biomass, processing food, and running marketing centers. This model showcases a sustainable economic development approach for the entire region.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, the President highlighted the success of the PURA model in collaboration with Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO), where the people of Periyar PURA villages worked with experts to develop internationally competitive prototypes for 55 lifestyle products. This cooperative venture has enhanced the innovative abilities of the villagers, enabling them to develop and produce internationally acceptable products. The President envisioned establishing similar PURAs across the country, bridging the rural-urban divide by creating 7000 such initiatives.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Prioritizing agricultural growth from seed to food. The President emphasized the importance of empowering farmers to protect and nurture the fertile land for a second green revolution. He met with over 6000 farmers from different States and Union Territories and was impressed by their keen interest in innovative agriculture practices. He believes that with the partnership of farmers, agricultural scientists, and industries, the nation can increase the agricultural GDP growth by at least 4% per annum through value addition.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Overcoming problems through partnership. The President shared an inspiring anecdote about Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy, a person born without hands and legs, who sang in front of him with great confidence and passion. This experience highlighted the importance of building partnerships across different sections of society to overcome problems and achieve success. The President also drew inspiration from the people of Urusa village in Jammu & Kashmir, who, despite facing devastating losses due to the 2005 earthquake, came together to rebuild their lives and community. The President appreciated the courage and resilience of the people of Urusa, who became the masters of their problems rather than allowing them to become their masters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, the President witnessed the bravery and resilience of the people of Chuckchucha village in Car Nicobar Islands, who took possession of the affected victims as their children and did not require orphanages. This inspiring story was captured in the poem \"Sea Waves,\" which the President composed on the spot. The President also addressed the Pan African Parliament on 16 September 2004, at Johannesburg, South Africa, where he emphasized the importance of connectivity for societal transformation. By connecting rural areas with urban societies, the PURA initiative has empowered villages and communities, enabling them to develop economically and socially.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Combating calamities with courage. The President's visit to Urusa village in Jammu & Kashmir, where he witnessed the resilience and courage of the people in the face of adversity, reinforced the importance of courage in combating calamities. The people of Urusa came together to rebuild their lives and community, demonstrating their indomitable spirit. The President also witnessed the bravery and resilience of the people of Car Nicobar Islands, who took possession of the affected victims as their children and did not require orphanages.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Fostering connectivity for societal transformation. The President's PURA initiative is a prime example of fostering connectivity for societal transformation. By connecting rural areas with urban societies, the PURA initiative has empowered villages and communities, enabling them to develop economically and socially.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Defending the nation as a matter of pride. The President's emphasis on empowering villages and promoting agricultural growth can be seen as a way to strengthen the nation's foundation and make it more resilient.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. Mobilizing a youth movement for a Developed India by 2020. The President's efforts to engage with over 15 lakh youth and his emphasis on empowering villages and promoting agricultural growth are key steps towards mobilizing a youth movement for a Developed India by 2020. The President's vision for a Developed India by 2020 is not just a distant goal, but a realistic possibility that can be achieved through the collective efforts of the youth, villages, and communities.\n",
